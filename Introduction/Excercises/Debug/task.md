# Debug
Your task is to write a program which asks for the hourly wage, 
hours worked, and the day of the week. 
The program should then print out the daily wages, which equal hourly wage multiplied by hours worked, 
except on Sundays when the hourly wage is doubled.
### Sample output:
```markdown
Hourly wage: 8.5
Hours worked: 3
Day of the week: Monday
Daily wages: 25.5 euros
```
### Sample output:
```markdown
Hourly wage: 12.5
Hours worked: 10
Day of the week: Sunday
Daily wages: 250.0 euros
```
The attached code has errors.
Debug and correct them

<div class="hint">
  A simple yet effective way of debugging a program is adding debugging print statements to your code. Verifying the results of your code with print commands gives a quick confirmation the code does what you want it to do.

### Sample output
``` markdown
...
condition: True
wages before: 120
wages after doubling: 240
Daily wages: 240.0 euros
```
